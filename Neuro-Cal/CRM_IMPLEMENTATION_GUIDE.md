## **📋 Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Database Setup**

Run the CRM migration script to create all necessary tables:

```bash
cd Neuro-Cal/backend
psql -d neurocal -f scripts/crm-migration.sql
```

This creates:
- **companies** - Organizations and companies
- **contacts** - Individual contacts with rich data
- **leads** - Sales leads and prospects
- **deals** - Sales opportunities and pipeline
- **crm_tasks** - CRM-specific tasks
- **activities** - Activity logging and audit trail
- **crm_settings** - User preferences and configuration

### **Step 2: Backend Integration**

The CRM routes are already added to your server. The system includes:

- **Contact Management**: Full CRUD operations
- **Lead Management**: Lead scoring and status tracking
- **Deal Management**: Pipeline stages and probability
- **Task Management**: CRM activities and follow-ups
- **Company Management**: Organization tracking
- **AI Features**: Smart lead scoring and deal probability

### **Step 3: Frontend Integration**

The CRM dashboard component is ready to use. Add it to your main app:

```tsx
// In your main App.tsx or routing
import CRMDashboard from './components/CRMDashboard';

// Add to your routes
<Route path="/crm" element={<CRMDashboard />} />
```
